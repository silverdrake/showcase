<span class="worktitle">The Grin</span> is a Doom2 episode I created in 2010 to work on my level design skills.<br>
I promise I'll add the full story of this level set and its design rationale and such, for now I'll just say the whole thing was created in a month's time and everything I made after version 0.9.0 was bug fixing to adapt to new versions of the various Doom ports I tested it on (for example, on most recent versions of GZDoom I found a secret passage broke because the space to pass through it became too narrow, I guess it was a rounding issue of some kind, which is why you have a 0.9.5 version made 7 years after the original).<br>

<h2>System Requirements</h2>

Any modern Doom port should do, but you need to have the original game data (you can find the game on GOG or Steam at a very low price nowadays):

<dl>
    <dt>Doom2 (doom2.wad)</dt><dd>needed to run the levels at all.</dd>
    <dt>Doom (doom.wad)</dt><dd>needed to get the proper background music for some levels (I mixed up the original section a bit to get the right mood).</dd>
</dl>

I'm assuming you know how to launch Doom with some extra files or have a loader in place, but here's a couple examples from my Linux box ($PATH_IWADS being a directory where you have both the original Doom WADS), launched from the directory where you unpack the zips:
<dl>
    <dt>ZDoom</dt><dd>zdoom -wnd -iwad $PATH_IWADS -game TheGrin -file graphtx3.wad GrinMusicSel.wad nb_flats.wad NB_RECOL.WAD q1tex.wad TheGrin-0.9.5.wad</dd>
    <dt>Doomsday</dt><dd>doomsday -wnd -iwad $PATH_IWADS -game doom2 -file graphtx3.wad GrinMusicSel.wad nb_flats.wad NB_RECOL.WAD q1tex.wad TheGrin-0.9.5.wad
</dd>
</dl>>

<h2>Files</h2>

<dl>
    <dt><a href="thegrin_data/TheGrin-0.9.5.wad.zip">The Grin WAD</a></dt><dd>the levels I made, from MAP01 to MAP09</dd>
    <dt><a href="thegrin_data/thegrin_supportwads.zip">Support WADs</a></dt><dd>the external WAD files I used for textures and such, so you don't have to hunt them down yourselves. I take no credit for anything you find in here, of course.</dd>
</dl>


<h2>Bonus Tracks</h2>

Some YouTube links the music I was listening to while making the levels.<br>
Barren Earth in particular would have been the soundtrack to the second half of the levels if I didn't go for the retro midi feel. I envisioned most of the levels structure and feel drawing from the atmosphere of this album.
