<h1>THE GRIN</h1>

<div>
<span class="worktitle">The Grin</span> is a Doom2 episode I created in 2010 to work on my level design skills.<br>
I promise I'll add the full story of this level set and its design rationale and such, for now I'll just say the whole thing was created in a month's time and everything I made after version 0.9.0 was bug fixing to adapt to new versions of the various Doom ports I tested it on (for example, on most recent versions of GZDoom I found a secret passage broke because the space to pass through it became too narrow, I guess it was a rounding issue of some kind, which is why you have a 0.9.5 version made 7 years after the original).<br>
Part of the "challenge" was that I wanted to see how I progressed so no level would be re-designed after I moved to the next one. So you can expect the first ones to be a bit limited; level 1 in particular but it lasts a minute or so, the others until level 4 are simpler in graphics and atmosphere than what comes next but should be fun enough, and the actual "meat" of wad starts on level 5, this second part being what I enjoyed it.<br>
It's still a sort of "first wad" for me, I had made a few levels in the 90s but they were devoid of any "proper" design, and I hung up my editor for a long time after that. Hope you enjoy these anyway.

<h2>System Requirements</h2>

Any modern Doom port should do, but you need to have the original game data (you can find the game on GOG or Steam at a very low price nowadays):

<dl>
    <dt>Doom2 (doom2.wad)</dt><dd>needed to run the levels at all.</dd>
    <dt>Doom (doom.wad)</dt><dd>needed to get the proper background music for some levels (mixed up the original order), use it as a PWAD in the launcher.</dd>
</dl>

I'm assuming you know how to launch Doom with some extra files or have a loader in place, but here's an example from my Linux box ($PATH_IWADS being a directory where you have both the original Doom WADS), with GZDoom launched from the directory where you unpack the zips:
<dl>
    <dt>GZDoom</dt><dd>gzdoom -wnd -iwad $PATH_IWADS/doom2.wad -file $PATH_IWADS/doom.wad graphtx3.wad nb_flats.wad NB_RECOL.WAD q1tex.wad TheGrin-0.9.5.1.wad</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Files</h2>

<dl>
    <dt><a href="thegrin_data/TheGrin-0.9.5.1.zip">The Grin WAD</a></dt><dd>the levels I made, from MAP01 to MAP09</dd>
    <dt><a href="thegrin_data/thegrin_supportwads.zip">Support WADs</a></dt><dd>the external WAD files I used for textures and such, so you don't have to hunt them down yourselves. I take no credit for anything you find in here, of course.</dd>
</dl>


<h2>Bonus Tracks</h2>

Some YouTube links the music I was listening to while making the levels.<br>
Barren Earth in particular would have been the soundtrack to the second half of the levels if I didn't go for the retro midi feel. I envisioned most of the levels structure and feel drawing from the atmosphere of this album.
